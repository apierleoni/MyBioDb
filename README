Web2py BioSQL Web Server Project Planning
================================

Status definintion:
D: DONE
IP: IN PROGRESS
TD: TO DO (will be done!)
P: PLANNED
I: ISSUE TO BE SOLVED
F: MAYBE IN SOME REMOTE FUTURE 

A: NEEDED FOR ALPHA VERSION

Relational DB Backend Handling
----------------------------
Relational dbs: to be handled via the web2py DAL
- BioSQL schema (MUST work with a standard BioSQL db) [D] [A]
- Upgraded BioSQL schema (with timestamps, and users) [D][A]
- Archive DB to handle history [D][A]

Backend to be tested:
- SQLite [D][A]
- PostgreSQL [D][A]
- MySQL [TD][A]
- Oracle [F]
- MSSQL [F]
- GAE [P]
- ...

WebServer Visualization
------------------------------
- Define visualization objects (main content, navigation three, tools, ...)[IP] [A]
- Build a simple HTML/CSS/JS(Jquery) theme (start from web2py default template in 1.94.x) [TD][A] 
	-nice downgrading in not too old browser [P]
- Default view of a bioentry [IP][A]
- Customizable view of a bioentry (methods to modify the default view tree) [TD]
- Integrate graphical representation of features:
	- Complete view with BioGraPy [IP][A]
	- Partial view with CSS (like uniprot server) [TD][A]
	- View features over sequence with javascript and checkbox [TD]
- Structure view with Jmol ? [AndreaZ]
- View bioentry history and diff [TD][A]

WebServer Query Engine
-------------------------------
- Query engine for BioSQL schema [D][A]
- Visual construction of complex queries with live counts [D][A]
- Custom page results depending on the biodb [D][A]
- Paginate results [D][A]
- Order results [TD][A]

 WebServer Administration
--------------------------------
- Include managment rigths via web2py auth [TD][A]
- Build a simple interface to handle users [TD]
- Access to batch load, archive and export functions [TD][A]

WebServer Data Editing
------------------------------
Strictly depending on the web2py auth
- AJAX inline data editing for text fields [IP][A]
	- Handle each SeqRecord property (annotations, features, ...) with a specific handler [IP]
- Design features over sequence [D][A]
- Embed rich text processing for suitable fields [D][A]

WebServer Data Inport
------------------------------
- Import from any Biopython supported format [D][A]
- Import from local files [D][A]
- Import from remote servers [IP][A]
- Import from DAS servers [IP][A]

WebServer Data Export
------------------------------
- Export pickled strings [D][A]
- Export in FASTA format [D] [A]
- Export in GenBank or EMBL formats [I] 
- Export in an ad hoc defined XML format [F]

WebServer Web Services
------------------------------
- REST (from web2py 1.94?)[TD][A]
- SOAP (from web2py 1.91) [TD][A]
- JSON? [P]
- Serve bioentry in a specific format, or pickled [TD][A]
- Remote queries [P] 

Tools to be included
------------------------
- BLAST interface (with graphical view) [D][A]
- Simple sequence analysis tools with plots [P]
- Define an analysis framework to add sequence analysis methods (including predictions) [P]
- Background process management (Eg. prediction daemons) [IP]

Code Organization
-----------------------
- GitHub repository [D][A]
- Use web2py plugin packaging as much as possible to make code portable [TD][A]

Required External Packages
------------------------------------
- Biopython
- DB backend package

Optional External Packages
------------------------------------
- BLAST+
- BioGraPy (matplotlib)


Estimated time to completion
------------------------------------
For core functions:
- WebServer Data Export: complete
- Relational DB Backend Handling: working
- Tools to be included: working
- WebServer Query Engine: Apr 2011
- WebServer Visualization: June 2011
- WebServer Administration: Jul 2011
